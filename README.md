# PRJ_Bird_Tracking

In this project, I have tracked the bird migration of seven birds using Python 3. I kept focus on bird named "Michelle" on some area. Matplotlib , Cartopy are vastly used. 

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.

Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses. Cartopy makes use of the powerful PROJ.4, NumPy and Shapely libraries and includes a programmatic interface built on top of Matplotlib for the creation of publication quality maps.

At time of developing this program following version of packages/libraries is used.
1. Python       version 3.7.1
2. cartopy      version 0.17.0
3. numpy        version 1.15.4
4. pandas       version 0.23.4
5. matplotlib   version 3.0.2

### Geographic scope

The tracked birds breed at the southern North Sea coast in three colonies, located in the ports of Zeebrugge (Belgium), Ostend (Belgium) and Vlissingen-Oost (the Netherlands). During the breeding season, their foraging range includes the west of Belgium and the Netherlands, northern France, the North Sea, and the English Channel. The Lesser Black-backed Gulls migrate south in winter, mainly hibernating in the south of Spain, Portugal, and North Africa.

### Taxonomic scope

The dataset contains tracking data from 108 Lesser Black-Backed Gulls (Larus fuscus) and 37 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding at the southern North Sea coast.

This is required & correct information upto my knowledge.
